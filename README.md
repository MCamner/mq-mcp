Local MCP server experiments and tooling for macOS.

`mq-mcp` is a small local-first lab for building, testing, and documenting MCP-related workflows on macOS. The goal is to make local MCP setup easier to understand, repeat, validate, and publish safely.

In the MQ stack, `mq-mcp` is the execution runtime: it exposes bounded tools,
safety metadata, review, memory, and bridge calls. Planning, routing, dry-runs,
and approval UX belong in `mq-agent`; repo health scoring belongs in
`repo-signal`; operator reports belong in `mq-hal`.

## Status

v1.10.0 — learning contract layer complete: learn hygiene report, compatibility aliases, and governance roadmap (Phases 1-9) done.
orchestration contract WARN acceptance policy, and ADR-006.

This repository is useful as:

- a local MCP server with 103 documented, safety-classified tools
- a packaged local CLI with `mq-mcp doctor`, `mq-mcp health`, `mq-mcp report`, `mq-mcp serve`, `mq-mcp validate`, and `mq-mcp tools`
- validated MCP profile templates for Claude Desktop, Codex, mq-agent, OpenAI bridge, and local macOS workflows
- a v1 stability baseline with `mq-mcp stability validate` and `docs/stability.json`
- a validation baseline with `scripts/validate.sh` and `scripts/release-check.sh`
- a repo-aware and macOS-aware MCP surface for mq-agent and local workflows
- a documented integration point for mq-hal and repo-signal
- an optional local-first Ollama learn extraction policy where mq-mcp remains
  the source of truth for validation, safety, and memory

It is **not yet** a production-ready MCP distribution or hidden daemon.

## Proof

- Python files compile in CI (`python -m compileall mq-mcp/`)
- `scripts/validate.sh` runs on every push — checks required files, Python syntax, MCP tool listing, and integration wiring
- Path access is scoped through `resolve_repo_file()` and `resolve_allowed_local_file()` — no arbitrary filesystem access
- Write-capable tools (`update_repo_file`, `edit_image`) never commit automatically
- Safety policy classifies all 103 tools by class, resolver, write capability, and subprocess use — see `docs/TOOL_SAFETY.md`
- Tests for path safety and tool output shape run in CI via `pytest`
- CI runs on `macos-latest` — not a Linux approximation

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and run the local installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MCamner/mq-mcp.git
cd mq-mcp
./scripts/install.sh
```

Check the local install:

```bash
mq-mcp doctor
mq-mcp health
mq-mcp tools
mq-mcp profiles list
mq-mcp stability validate
```

Run the local MCP server experiment:

```bash
mq-mcp serve
```

Run validation:

```bash
mq-mcp validate
```

Write a redacted troubleshooting bundle:

```bash
mq-mcp report --json
mq-mcp bundle --validate
```

Run the bridge with a prompt:

```bash
cd mq-mcp
uv run python bridge.py "List the available MCP tools."
```

## Requirements

The Python project currently declares:

- Python `>=3.11`
- `mcp[cli]`
- `openai`
- `psutil`
- `pandas`
- `pillow`
- `pyguitarpro`
- `requests`

If your local Python version does not match the project requirement, use `uv` to manage the environment.

## Environment

Copy the example environment file before running anything that needs API credentials (run from inside `mq-mcp/mq-mcp/`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Do **not** commit real API keys, tokens, private paths, or secrets.

## Demo

See [`docs/demo.md`](docs/demo.md) for example commands and expected output.

Quick example — list available tools through the bridge:

```bash
uv --directory mq-mcp run python bridge.py "List the available MCP tools."
```

Expected response lists all 103 MCP tools with descriptions.

## Integration map

See [`docs/integration.md`](docs/integration.md) for how `mq-mcp`, `mq-hal`, and `repo-signal` work together as a local assistant and repo-quality stack.

See [`docs/orchestration-boundary.md`](docs/orchestration-boundary.md) for the
practical boundary between `mq-mcp`, `mq-agent`, `mq-hal`, `repo-signal`, and
`mq-image-analyze`.

See [`docs/LEARN_OLLAMA.md`](docs/LEARN_OLLAMA.md) for the optional
Ollama-backed learn extraction policy. Ollama may be used only for local pattern
extraction; mq-mcp owns the learn contract, validation, safety classes, review
logic, and memory writes.

## Ecosystem

`mq-mcp` is the execution runtime in the MQ ecosystem — it exposes tools and enforces safety boundaries. It does not plan or orchestrate.

| Repo               | Use when you need to…                                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mq-mcp`           | Execute a tool, run a review, read a file, check safety metadata       |
| `mq-agent`         | Plan a multi-step workflow or route a request across repos             |
| `mq-hal`           | Get a system status report, release brief, or operator summary         |
| `repo-signal`      | Score a repo's publish readiness or run a documentation quality check  |
| `mq-image-analyze` | Analyze a screenshot, diagram, or visual render                        |

**Which tools run automatically (no approval needed):** Class A and B — all read-only tools. Examples: `read_repo_file`, `git_status`, `repo_signal_analyze`, `get_system_resources`.

**Which tools require explicit human approval:** Class C (writes files) and Class D (opens apps or runs subprocesses). Examples: `update_repo_file`, `run_tests`, `open_terminal`, `set_reminder`.

See [`docs/orchestration-boundary.md`](docs/orchestration-boundary.md) for the full boundary definition and profile-to-class mapping.

## Safety notes

See [`docs/security.md`](docs/security.md) for the MCP safety policy.
See [`docs/TOOL_SAFETY.md`](docs/TOOL_SAFETY.md) for the full tool class map.

This project is local-first and experimental.

Before using or extending it:

- review what each MCP tool can access
- avoid committing `.env` files
- keep filesystem access scoped and explicit
- avoid hardcoded machine-specific paths where possible
- prefer read-only tools until validation is solid
- document every command that touches local files or credentials

Automation rule of thumb:

- Class A/B tools may be used automatically when the caller accepts the
  documented read-only or external-access behavior.
- Class C/D tools require an explicit human approval gate because they write
  files, open apps, or run subprocesses.
- Review tools should be treated as explicit review actions when they call
  OpenAI, even if their local filesystem behavior is read-only.

## Bridget voice

Bridget can optionally speak responses locally on macOS using the built-in `say` command. Disabled by default, no external TTS.

```bash
bridget --voice-list
bridget --voice-name Alva
bridget --voice-on
bridget --voice-test
bridget --voice-off
```

See [`docs/bridget-voice.md`](docs/bridget-voice.md).

## Validation

Run the local validation script from the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

The validation checks:

- required project files
- absence of debug and backup files
- Python syntax compilation
- MCP tool listing
- core MCP tools including `read_repo_file`, `list_repo_files`, `search_repo`, `git_status`, `git_diff`, `validate_project`, and `update_repo_file`
- integration documentation wiring
- integration smoke checks for mq-hal and repo-signal MCP tools
- bridge tool discovery checks for the tools Bridget can see through `bridge.py --tools`

You can also run validation through the bridge:

```bash
cd mq-mcp
uv run python bridge.py "Run project validation."
```

## Development checks

Useful local checks:

```bash
git status
python -m compileall mq-mcp/
./scripts/check-bridge-tool-discovery.sh
```

Run the safety tests:

```bash
uv --directory mq-mcp run pytest ../tests -v
```
