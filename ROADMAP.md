# mq-mcp Roadmap

mq-mcp is the local MCP tool layer for the mq ecosystem.

It exposes safe, repo-aware and system-aware tools that can be used by local
agents, OpenAI bridge workflows, mq-agent, mqlaunch and future HAL-style local
automation.

The goal is not to create an unrestricted local automation server.

The goal is to create a controlled, documented and testable MCP surface where
every tool has:

- a clear purpose
- a safety class
- documented inputs
- predictable outputs
- path boundaries
- tests
- failure behavior

---

## Current status

Current project phase:

```text
v0.3.x — usable macOS MCP toolkit
```

Completed foundation:

- local MCP server
- OpenAI/MCP bridge
- repo-scoped file tools
- system resource tools
- git tools
- shell/subprocess safety boundaries
- explicit filesystem allowlist
- Bridget identity asset
- validation script
- docs and GitHub Pages
- tool safety documentation
- tool inventory sync
- Python version documentation cleanup

Current priority:

```text
v0.4.0 — Tool contract and safety map v2
```

Reason:

v0.3.1 is complete. CI is green, docs are in sync, and validation scripts
collect and report all failures. The next step is to make every tool
self-describing so mq-agent can consume tool metadata safely.

## v1.0.0 — Stable local MCP platform

Goal:

Make mq-mcp stable enough to be the default MCP tool layer for the mq ecosystem.

### v1.0.0 requirements

- [ ] Stable server startup
- [ ] Stable tool registry
- [ ] Stable tool metadata schema
- [ ] Stable safety classes
- [ ] Stable filesystem boundary model
- [ ] Stable config format
- [ ] Stable validation command
- [ ] Stable install flow
- [ ] Complete tool docs
- [ ] Complete troubleshooting docs
- [ ] Complete example workflows
- [ ] Green CI
- [ ] Protected main branch
- [ ] GitHub release
- [ ] GitHub Pages documentation
- [ ] No known critical safety gaps

---

## Long-term ideas

These are intentionally not scheduled yet.

- Bridget voice mode
- Bridget terminal avatar mode
- richer local TUI
- local model fallback
- Ollama integration
- local event history
- repo health history
- MCP tool marketplace
- integration with mq-hal
- integration with mq-ums
- integration with repo-signal semantic memory
- cross-repo tool inventory
- visual safety map
- generated architecture diagrams
- demo videos or GIFs

---

## Design principles

mq-mcp should remain:

- local-first
- explicit
- safe by default
- repo-aware
- path-bounded
- testable
- observable
- easy to validate
- easy to disable
- useful without hidden automation

The server should expose tools.

It should not become an unrestricted remote-control layer.

---

## Safety principles

mq-mcp must never:

- expose arbitrary filesystem access by default
- run subprocess tools silently
- ignore path boundaries
- leak API keys
- print secrets in logs
- mutate repositories without explicit tool intent
- hide dangerous behavior behind friendly names
- treat AI-generated requests as automatically trusted

Every powerful tool must have:

- a safety class
- documented inputs
- documented outputs
- tests
- error handling
- explicit approval behavior when used by higher-level agents

---

## Current recommended next step

Work on:

```text
v0.4.0 — Tool contract and safety map v2
```

This release should make every exposed tool self-describing and safe to reason
about before adding more tool surface or deeper mq-agent integration.
